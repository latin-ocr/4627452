This reei of microfiirn contains materiei
ι which has peper coior changes, stains, cr
illustratione (some of which may appearcn
paqes mixed with printed text). in order tc
ensure thet eii text end illustratione ere
iegibie, exposure settinqs must be changed.
Therefore, when text end illustratione exist
ι in e single imeqe or when materiei
becquounds differ, such frames may need
’ tc be exposed twice. ,
The first exposure reflecte the cernere
operator’ s best effert tc capture the majority
of the text; the second exposure reflecte the
cernere operator’s best effert to capture
iliustretive materiei or the remaining text. it
is hoped thet this practice witi resuit in e ff
micrcfiirn product thet fuiiy serves the neede-
of most reseerchers.
